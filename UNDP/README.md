Exploring Post-Harvest Food Loss and Electricity Access in Africa

### Project Caption
 Currently, post-harvest food loss, defined as crop losses in quality and quantity that occur between harvest and the moment of human consumption, is one of the main factors to food insecurity and hunger across Africa. This project explores the relationship between electricity access and points in the process with the greatest food loss in order to highlight areas that need the greatest attention.
