### Project title
Exploring Post-Harvest Food Loss and Electricity Access in Africa

### Project Caption
Post-harvest food loss, defined as a reduction in quantity and quality of food between the farm and the point of sale, is one of the main factors of food insecurity and hunger across Africa. This project explores the relationship between electricity access and post-harvest food loss of one major crop, Maize, in order to highlight areas within the food supply chain that need the greatest improvements.
